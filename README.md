# StationBuilder
An isometric tile game engine using SFML to talk to OpenGL. 
End goal is to create a space trading/empire simulation where the player controls
multiple space stations, outposts and planetary bases aswell as a fleet of space craft.
The player can build and customise all their assets in a tile based editor.

Would like to eventually introduce AI and multiplayer.
